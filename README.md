# Scrolly-telling with Mapbox: Covid Trail in the Philippines

In this project, I used Scrolly-telling by Mapbox to tell a story about the timeline of Covid-19 in the Philippines, starting from when and how the first case emerged in the country to the current statistics. The data used in this project I collected from the internet. 

You may find a screen-capped video of it here to give you a general feel of how it looks like: https://github.com/avpresbitero/covidtrailph/blob/master/Scrollytelling%20Template%20-%20Google%20Chrome%202020-04-16%2002-52-08.mp4
